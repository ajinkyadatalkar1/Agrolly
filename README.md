## What is an Agrolly? ##
Agrolly is a mobile app to help rural household farmers in developing countries to tackle the challenges of climate change effectively and to increase potential financial credits availability for oneself. Using Agrolly, rural household farmers can connect and learn from each other by building a national-level network. Household farmers can also use Agrolly for integrated analysis of climate, especially for the weather, water, and soil for productive produce. Therefore, farmers will be able to efficiently scheme a plantation process and prevent disaster risks caused by extreme weather conditions. Besides, national and local banks and financial institutes can leverage Agrolly to effectively calculate the relative risks and then make monetary credits and loans more inclusive for rural household farmers.

## Short description
### What's the problem?
Household farmers in many emerging countries encounter a massive burden of economic exclusion and climate change. The agricultural farming sector is mostly not well advanced so that household farmers traditionally lack access to crucial resources. Those include first, farmers' networking from which they can learn and exchange know-how. Second, information on regional climate trends and knowledge of climate-smart practices. Third, improved on-farm techniques and data capabilities. All of these factors increase farmers' resilience in the face of environmental challenges, and also financial credits and loans favorable to their life situation. While rural household farmers are the ones who least contribute to climate change, they are the most vulnerable to changing economic and climatic conditions. Rural household farmers report they are feeling unable to get ahead of the market and are thus trapped in an endless cycle of financial struggle and poverty. Access to credits, networking, and climate-related information, most importantly on weather, would help to break this cycle. On the other hand, local banks struggle to expand financial inclusivity to the rural household farmers even though they want to invest in green development and sustainable social businesses. Banks not being able to improve loan and credit system for household farmers is that the banks also lack a credible platform which can help them calculate the risk and opportunities in the agricultural farming sector.

## How can technology help?

* Connect rural household farmers with the ability to exchange text and photos.
* Real-time weather monitoring (text and visual).
* Provide Long-Term Weather Forecast (temperature and rainfall). 
* Crop selection based on the forthcoming forecast. 
* Crop risk assessment by identifying weather problem areas.

## What are the Languages available?
English, Portuguese (Brazil), Mongolian.

## The architecture
![picture alt](https://github.com/ajinkyadatalkar1/Agrolly/blob/master/Arquitecture.png?raw=true/20x10 "Architecture")
1. the IBM’s “the weather company” to display hourly and weekly forecasts based on the location of the user.
2. We collect the weather information for the past 5 years from NASA and we generate annual predictions with the help of the IBM Watson studio.
3. For more information related regression , please read our article:

## Project roadmap
![picture alt](https://github.com/ajinkyadatalkar1/Agrolly/blob/master/Agrolly_Road_Map.PNG?raw=true/40x20 "Roadmap")
* For the 1st Phase, we focused on given farmers tools and knowledge to fight against changes in the weather. 
* The 2nd phase is planned to focus on the interactions between farmers so they can increase their relationship. This will enable them to know what others are planting and explore their options. We are also planning to integrate some tools so the farmers can leverage their know-how, such as the expert advice feature will allow farmers to get in touch with specialists and trends in the agriculture sector.
* Our 3rd goal is to connect small farmers with banks and customers, by implementing QR code for food traceability and farming credit score algorithms.
